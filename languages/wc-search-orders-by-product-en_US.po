"This WooCommerce extension automatically adds product search, product type "
"and product category filter dropdown in WooCommerce Orders screen. You can "
"find orders by typing just a few characters of your product name. As you "
"start typing in the search input, you will see instant results popping up "
"inside the dropdown menu. The auto listing of the matching products with "
"same characters inside the dropdown will help you in typo tolerance or if "
"you misspell the product name."
